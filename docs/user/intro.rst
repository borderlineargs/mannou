Introduction
============

**Mannou** is a manga downloader from various sites.
You can use this project as CLI program:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mannou {url}

as executable module:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m mannou {url}

or as library:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import mannou


Please read :ref:`installation` to install **Mannou**,
or :ref:`quickstart` if you already have it in your machine.


The Reason
----------

**Mannou** is actually created in order to learn **Python** with actual useful
software for myself. Why I choose to create a manga downloader is because
I spent so much money in mobile data in order to read manga.
So when I use WiFi, I can spent my time to surfing and downloading a
manga in the same time. Hence, profit.

I hope this project also help you.
